# NER-model-by-fine-tuning-Bert-Transformer
This repository contains code and resources for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that has been fine-tuned using the BERT transformer model. The model has been trained on the CONLL2003 dataset, which is available through the Hugging Face datasets library (dataset: eriktks/conll2003).

### Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and other entities within text. This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model to perform NER tasks using the CONLL2003 dataset.

### Features
- Fine-tuning BERT for NER tasks.
- Utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets libraries.
- Includes scripts for training, evaluation, and inference.
- Comprehensive results and performance metrics.

### Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Clone the repository by using the command
```
git clone https://github.com/tanishavyass22/NER-model-by-fine-tuning-Bert-Transformer
```
Install dependencies by running the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
##### Download the Dataset
The CONLL2003 dataset can be downloaded directly using the Hugging Face datasets library.
```
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset('eriktks/conll2003')
```
##### Fine-tuning the Model
The main script for fine-tuning the BERT model is provided in the Jupyter Notebook NER using transformers.ipynb. To fine-tune the model, simply run the notebook cells step by step.

##### Evaluating the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model using the same Jupyter Notebook. The evaluation steps are included towards the end of the notebook.

##### Training
The Jupyter Notebook (NER using transformers.ipynb) handles the fine-tuning process. You can customize the training process by modifying the hyperparameters within the notebook.

##### Evaluation
The evaluation steps are included in the Jupyter Notebook. These steps will compute and display various performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

##### Results
The results of the model, including precision, recall, and F1 score, will be displayed in the notebook after running the evaluation cells.
